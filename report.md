Data processing:

* We found out that we have the following dimension: 

* We have splitted the data into 70% training data, 15% validation data and 15% test data

* Scaled the data so every data point is larger or equal to zero and smaller or equal to pi


Loss function

* We use log_loss as out loss function since we have a classifier




Choice of QNN

* We tried 3 curcuits:
    - Real amplitudes
    - Convolution Neural Network



What we learned:



Hardships:

* Long computation time 
* Gradient decent is slow
